# Dungeon Seed

ðŸŒ± Seed cracker for Minecraft 1.12.2.
Works by reverse engineering 3 distinct dungeon seeds. Then generates possible cross-reference combos and searches them for world seeds. Permanent WIP state, so no user interface is planned. Load it up in your IDE to code own routines.
#### Method will fail if a lake was generated along one of the dungeons. Pick your structures carefully! Make sure no lakes are present in neighboring chunks as well.
